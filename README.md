# Crystal Collector

You must help the Crystal Gems save the world!  

Below is your mission briefing:

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

You will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

The game will hide this amount until you click a crystal.
When you do click one, it will update your score counter.
You win if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

You lose if your score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever you win or lose.

When the game begins again, you should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, your score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
The game should show the number of games you have won and lost. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
